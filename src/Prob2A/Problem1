Compute the number of primitive operations for each of the following algorithm
fragments. The “increment counter” step has not been mentioned explicitly – be sure
to take this into account in your computations. Hint: When faced with nested for
loops, compute the number of steps required by the inner loop first, and then figure
out the effect of the outer loop.
                                    Operations:
A.  sum ← 0                             1
    for i ← 0 to n-1 do                 n + 3
        sum ← sum + 1                   2n
        {increment counter i}           2n
                                    Total: 5n + 4

B.  sum ← 0                             1
    for i ← 0 to n-1 do                 n + 3
        for j ← 0 to n-1 do             n(n + 3)
            sum ← sum + 1               2(n^2)
            {increment counter j}       2(n^2)
        {increment counter i}           2n
                                    Total: 5(n^2) + 6n + 4
