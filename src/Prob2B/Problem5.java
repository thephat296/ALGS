      D. Prove BubbleSort is correct (you may use your updated version for this if you
      want). Hint: Show that after the loop with i = 0, the element in position n â€“ 1
      is in final sorted order; after i = 1, the last two elements arr[n-2], arr[n-1] are
      in final sorted order. In general, after pass i, the elements arr[n-i-1]..arr[n-1]
      are in final sorted order.
      <answer>
       Let I(i) be the statement the elements arr[n-i-1]..arr[n-1] are in final sorted order.
       Claim: After pass #i, I(i) is true
       Base case i = 0:
           After pass #0, arr[n - 1] is in final sorted order, it is the largest element in the array
       Induction step:
           Assume I(i) is true after pass #i, for 1 <= i < n - 1, arr[n - i - 1]..arr[n - 1] are in final sorted order
           After pass #i+1, arr[n - i - 2] is put in correct sorted order.
           Thus, I(i + 1) is correct. arr[n - (i + 1) - 1]..arr[n - 1] are in final sorted order
           This proves the claim.

    E. Show that BubbleSort is inversion-bound (you can use either version of the algorithm here).
    <answer>
        Suppose A is an input array of distinct integers, i<j, and A[i] > A[j] (in other words, (A[i], A[j]) is an inversion in A).
        Suppose X is an integer between A[i] and A[j], A[i]->X->A[j], there are 2 cases:
            X < A[i]
                Step 1: A[i] and X will swap places with each other, resulting in X->A[i]->A[j]
                Step 2: A[i] and A[j] will swap places with each other
            X > A[i]
                Step 1: X and A[j] will swap places with each other, resulting in A[i]->A[j]->X
                Step 2: A[i] and A[j] will swap places with each other
        In conclusion, at some point, bubble sort will perform a comparison of A[i] and A[j] and then will swap A[i], A[j]
        Hence, bubble sort is an inversion-bound sorting algorithm.
